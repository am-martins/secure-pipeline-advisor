# Contribution Guidelines

Would be great to see contributions to this project and we have tried to make it as easier as we could.
If you would like to contribute code to this project you can do so through GitHub by following a pretty simple set of steps.

## Documentation

If you contribute anything that changes the behavior of the application,
document it in the following places as applicable:
* the code itself, through clear comments and unit tests
* [README](README.md)

This includes new features, additional variants of behavior, and breaking
changes.

## Found a bug?

You can use [issues](../../issues) to report bugs. Choose the `bug template` and provide all the requested information, otherwise your issue could be closed. Please also feel free to submit a Pull Request with a fix for the bug!

## Have a Feature Request?

All feature requests should start with [submitting an issue](../../issues/new) documenting the user story and acceptance criteria. Choose the `feature request template` and provide all the requested information, otherwise your issue could be closed. Again, feel free to submit a `Pull Request` with a proposed implementation of the feature.

2. Clone your fork and create a new branch: `$git checkout https://github.com/your_username_here/repo_name -b feature/name_for_new_branch`.
